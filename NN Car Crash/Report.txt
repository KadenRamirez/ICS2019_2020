	This project was done in anaconda version 3.8. The libraries include numpy 1.16, sci-kit,
pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, and seaborn.The data was then retrieved from
https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/motor-vehicle-crashes-case-information-beginning-2009.
The needed data was then converted to numerical values while everything else was deleted.
The data was then normalized using the normalize function. The data was scaled so that no 
value exceeded 11.0. The Nnural network was then trained on half of the dataset and tested on the
rest. The hidden layer size was 12 nodes in the first hidden layer and 6 nodes in the second
hidden layer. The random_state was set to 0, the max_iter was set to 10000, the cv was set
to 4. To verify the test results the percentage correct was compared to the cross validation results.
This was accomplished by usign the clf.score function and the cross validation function.
